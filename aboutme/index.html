    <p>Hello everyone! I just want to introduce myself. I live on a beautiful island 
      in South East Asia named the Philippines. I'm 23 years old, not yet married. 
      I started getting interested with technology at younger age that's why I decided
       to pursue Bachelors of Applied Technology. I like playing video games, singing 
       and listening to music, going out with friends, outdoor activities and family 
       bonding.

      I have been member been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ for 15 years. 
      I want to share my favorite scripture verse about the Atonement of our Lord 
      Jesus Christ. It is written in the <strong>Book of Mormon Chapter 19 verse 9</strong>. 
      <em>"And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; 
      wherefore they scourge him, and <u>he suffereth it</u>; and they smite him, and 
      <u>he suffereth it</u>. Yea, they spit upon him, and <u>he suffereth it</u>, <strong>because 
      of his loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men</strong>."</em> 
      As I am putting myself in His shoes, that could be the worst feeling for me. But he suffered 
      those trials ang challenges for us to be with Him and Our Heavenly Father someday. 
      He did it because of His never-ending love for us. Now the question is, are we willing to 
      suffer everything even the worst feeling we could feel just to be with Him and Our Heavenly 
      Father someday? I know if we trust and have faith in Him just as He trusted and had faith on 
      Our Heavenly Father, we will overcome every trials and challenges we are facing and will face.
